# README - Module 2 - VBA Challenge
by Nathon Burwick

This is my submission for the Module 2 Challenge.

I completed the script which will loop through all existing worksheets using a VBA Dictionary to verify that the ticker was unique and store the latest closing value as I looped through the range. This allowed me to calculate the percent change for the year per each ticker as I went down the range. I was also used the worksheet function "SUMIF" to find the Total Stock Volume and store it within a variable to print into the cell.

These are screenshots of my results for the assignment and you may find the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file and my vba_challenge.bas file you may use to import and run through the VBA Project Editor:
